TypeScript has become an essential tool for React developers. In this post, we'll explore how to set up and use TypeScript in your React projects.

## Why TypeScript?

TypeScript provides:
- **Type Safety**: Catch errors at compile time
- **Better IDE Support**: Autocomplete and IntelliSense
- **Improved Refactoring**: Rename and refactor with confidence

## Setting Up

First, create a new React + TypeScript project:

\`\`\`bash
npm create vite@latest my-app -- --template react-ts
cd my-app
npm install
\`\`\`

## Creating Components

Here's a simple typed component:

\`\`\`tsx
interface ButtonProps {
  label: string;
  onClick: () => void;
}

const Button = ({ label, onClick }: ButtonProps) => {
  return <button onClick={onClick}>{label}</button>;
};
\`\`\`

## Conclusion

TypeScript and React work great together, providing a robust development experience!`,

    content: `# Building a Personal Portfolio with GitHub Pages

GitHub Pages is a free hosting service that's perfect for personal portfolios and project documentation.

## What You'll Need

- A GitHub account
- Basic knowledge of HTML/CSS or a static site generator
- Git installed on your computer

## Steps to Deploy

1. **Create a Repository**: Name it \`username.github.io\`
2. **Add Your Code**: Push your website code to the main branch
3. **Enable GitHub Pages**: Go to Settings → Pages
4. **Visit Your Site**: https://username.github.io

## Using GitHub Actions

For automated deployments, set up a GitHub Actions workflow:

\`\`\`yaml
name: Deploy

on:
  push:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
        uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3
\`\`\`

That's it! Your site will automatically deploy on every push.`,

    excerpt: "How I started contributing to open source projects and what I learned along the way.",
    content: `# My Journey into Open Source

Contributing to open source can be intimidating at first, but it's incredibly rewarding.

## Getting Started

I started by:
1. Finding projects I used regularly
2. Reading through the CONTRIBUTING.md files
3. Starting with small issues labeled "good first issue"

## What I Learned

- **Communication**: Clear communication is key in distributed teams
- **Code Review**: How to give and receive constructive feedback
- **Testing**: The importance of thorough testing

## Tips for Beginners

- Start small - even fixing typos helps!
- Ask questions - maintainers are usually helpful
- Be patient - it takes time to get familiar with a codebase

Happy coding! 🚀`,
