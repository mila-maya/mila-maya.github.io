    title: "How I Set Up My Master's Thesis (LaTeX + VS Code + AI)",
    slug: "getting-started-masters-thesis-workflow",
    excerpt: "A practical setup for a code-heavy thesis: LaTeX, VS Code, and AI tools that actually help.",
    content: `When I started my computational master's thesis, I spent the first week just figuring out tooling. LaTeX errors, broken builds, files everywhere. I wished someone had handed me a working template and said "start here."

This is that guide. One command builds the PDF, everything is version-controlled, and the setup is simple enough to maintain under deadline stress.

## Direct downloads

- [Download LaTeX starter template (ZIP)](/downloads/thesis-template.zip)
- [Download compiled thesis PDF](/downloads/thesis-template.pdf)
- [Download presentation PDF](/downloads/thesis-template-presentation.pdf)

## 1) What you need

- **LaTeX distribution** - Windows: [MiKTeX](https://miktex.org/download) / Linux & macOS: [TeX Live](https://www.tug.org/texlive/)
- **Editor** - [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
- **Version control** - [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- **VS Code extension** - James-Yu.latex-workshop

## 2) Verify and build

Make sure these all return a version number:

~~~powershell
pdflatex --version
latexmk -v
bibtex --version
~~~

If one fails, fix it now. Then build your thesis:

~~~powershell
latexmk -pdf -interaction=nonstopmode thesis.tex
~~~

Clean up build artifacts: \`latexmk -c\`

## 3) Folder structure

- [thesis.tex](/template-files/thesis.tex)
- frontmatter/ — [cover.tex](/template-files/frontmatter/cover.tex), [abstracts.tex](/template-files/frontmatter/abstracts.tex)
- chapters/ — [01-intro.tex](/template-files/chapters/01-intro.tex), [02-methods.tex](/template-files/chapters/02-methods.tex), [03-results.tex](/template-files/chapters/03-results.tex)
- [bib/references.bib](/template-files/bib/references.bib)
- figures/
- appendix/
- presentation/ — [presentation.tex](/template-files/presentation/presentation.tex)
- [Makefile](/template-files/Makefile)

## 4) Build your presentation from the thesis

No need to start slides from scratch - reuse what you already have:

- thesis figures go directly into slides
- key tables become summary slides
- AI tools help compress long sections into bullet points

~~~powershell
cd presentation
latexmk -pdf -interaction=nonstopmode presentation.tex
~~~

## 6) How I use AI

I use Claude and Codex in VS Code. They're genuinely helpful for:

- improving outline clarity
- rewriting paragraphs without changing meaning
- debugging LaTeX errors when you paste the exact log

A few things I learned the hard way:

- AI-generated references look real but often don't exist — always verify
- It's tempting to accept a nicely worded paragraph, but check the claims behind it too

Good luck with your thesis.

    content: `# Building a Personal Portfolio with GitHub Pages

GitHub Pages is a free hosting service that's perfect for personal portfolios and project documentation.

## What You'll Need

- A GitHub account
- Basic knowledge of HTML/CSS or a static site generator
- Git installed on your computer

## Steps to Deploy

1. **Create a Repository**: Name it \`username.github.io\`
2. **Add Your Code**: Push your website code to the main branch
3. **Enable GitHub Pages**: Go to Settings → Pages
4. **Visit Your Site**: https://username.github.io

## Using GitHub Actions

For automated deployments, set up a GitHub Actions workflow:

\`\`\`yaml
name: Deploy

on:
  push:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
        uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3
\`\`\`

That's it! Your site will automatically deploy on every push.`,

    excerpt: "How I started contributing to open source projects and what I learned along the way.",
    content: `# My Journey into Open Source

Contributing to open source can be intimidating at first, but it's incredibly rewarding.

## Getting Started

I started by:
1. Finding projects I used regularly
2. Reading through the CONTRIBUTING.md files
3. Starting with small issues labeled "good first issue"

## What I Learned

- **Communication**: Clear communication is key in distributed teams
- **Code Review**: How to give and receive constructive feedback
- **Testing**: The importance of thorough testing

## Tips for Beginners

- Start small - even fixing typos helps!
- Ask questions - maintainers are usually helpful
- Be patient - it takes time to get familiar with a codebase

Happy coding! 🚀`,
